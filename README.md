# Mapping vegetation traits in Google Earth Engine using Gaussian process models and the Sentinel-2 top-of-atmosphere product.

This is a guideline of running a GPR model for mapping vegetation variables on Google Earth Engine (GEE), as explained in Estévez et al., 2022.

Please click the link below to get access to the GEE repository (a GEE account is required) to run the GPR models (See the "Reader" section under the "Script" tab): https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/jose_estevez/S2TOA_GPR_MapVegetation  
<!-- (If you are not a GEE user and interested in the apps, please visit: Earth Engine Apps **(pending for update)**  -->

Please cite the code as: **(pending for update the paper reference)**.   
Please email me at jose.a.estevez@uv.es for any further information.   


The GEE repository includes the codes for some mapping demos:

**1. Mapping at local scale**

**2. Mapping uncertainties**

**3. Mapping at national scale**
